        <p>The Emergency Management Accreditation Program (EMAP) has built a reputation as an organization focused on providing clear, objective, and meaningful standards that relate directly to the specific programmatic features of emergency management here in the US and abroad. As with any program, especially with one that is centered on emergency and disaster preparedness, items such as national trends, real world events, and federal policies change how emergency management programs are implemented, and in turn, how EMAP applies and uses its standards.</p><br />
        <p>EMAP has taken many positive steps in the development and application of new training initiatives that will benefit both candidate programs as well as our assessors. It is our primary goal to ensure that we have individuals who are well-trained and focused on the Emergency Management Standard by EMAP, the foundation for the majority of our projects and activities.</p><br />

To this end, it has been determined that EMAP adopt a continuing education program for assessors, team leaders, and those facilitating EMAP-oriented training and workshops. What follows is a basic outline of that program:</p><br />
